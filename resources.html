				<a href="https://www.cps.edu/careers/">Search for Careers in CPS</a>
			<p>This resource is key to finding jobs within CPS. You can find positions including; teaching, SECA, custodial, clerical, and administrative through this portal. The portal is updated immediately as principals update job openings. While applying for a job through this portal, be sure to attach your resume, a cover-letter, and reach out to the school personally to make yourself stand out as a candidate! </p>
				<a href="https://www.ctulocal1.org/">Chicago Teachers Union Page</a>
			<p>The Teachers Union page is the place to get important updates regarding progress or changes within CPS. As the CPS contract is being negotiated this year, you will be able to find information about negotiations and headway with this process as well as meeting times and dates so you can show support.</p>
				<a href="https://www.cps.edu/staff/">CPS staff page</a>
			<p>As a newly hired teacher, the CPS staff page will give you access to all the tools you need digitally in the classroom. Here you will find resources for requesting a substitute, curriculum mapping, timekeeper, and many other tools. You will likely be introduced to this at your new teacher orientation but it might be beneficial to familiarize yourself prior!</p>
